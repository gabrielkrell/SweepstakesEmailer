SweepstakesEmailer sends out scheduled emails for you.  By default, it'll send five emails per day.

To use it:
 - Install `namedlist` with `pip install namedlist`
 - Run SetPreferences.py to configure emails
 - Make a cron entry or use another program to schedule SweepstakesEmailer to run daily.  If run more than once per day, it still won't send more than five emails.

Before use, you should test it by setting it up to send email to yourself.
